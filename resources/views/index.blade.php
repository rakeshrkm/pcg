                <p>We had approached Mazenet with 20+ open positions for SAP & Cyber Security domains to fill roles in the specific regions like Coimbatore, Hyderabad & Pune. They have really done a brilliant job by putting the most experienced resources in the task along with an AI system to close the positions within TAT. The impressive point is the hiring ratio they are maintaining (3:1). Highly recommended Mazenet for any bulk hiring or hiring for advanced skills.</p>

By optimizing this metric, we ensure faster onboarding, which reduces the risk of losing top talent to competitors.

                     <li><span class="whatwedotitile">A - Assessment of Quality of Hire : </span>Assessing the quality of hire involves evaluating new hires' performance, productivity, and cultural fit. This assessment ensures that new employees meet or exceed expectations and contribute positively to the organization's goals. By focusing on quality, we help our clients build a workforce that drives business success and fosters a positive organizational culture.</li>
                     <li><span class="whatwedotitile">D - Development of Recruitment Metrics : </span>The development of recruitment metrics involves the continuous improvement and monitoring of key indicators such as cost-to-hire, time-to-hire, and quality of hire.
